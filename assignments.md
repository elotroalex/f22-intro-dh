### Class Engagement

This course requires us to be present for each other. This doesn't mean speaking during seminar. You really don't have to if you don't feel like it. What's the point of requiring you to? That said, it is important that we are there for each other, helping each other out, doing our part, asking questions when we don't understand something, answering them when we do. For the duration of the semester we are a collective, the team we have---Yankees or Bad News Bears, we are what we got.
